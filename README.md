# 🛡️ SENTINEL GRID V2 — Billing System Protection with Adaptive Deception

**ITWEB Secure Innovation Hackathon 2026** | *Team: Neutral Fence*

---

## 🎯 One-Sentence Summary

> *"While the recent Ekurhuleni billing system breach exposed how vulnerable municipal financial systems are to catastrophic data manipulation—a gap our Sentinel Grid tool directly addresses—our prototype simulates a billing system on one screen and a hacking interface on the other, demonstrating how five existing security layers feeding every log into Sentinel Grid trigger perfectly nested honeypots that convince attackers their hack succeeded while keeping all real billing data completely intact."*

## 🚀 Live Prototype

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|

## 📋 How to Run / How to Test

### Step 1: Click the prototype link

Open your browser and go to: **[https://heckerthon.netlify.app/](https://heckerthon.netlify.app/)** *(update with your deployed link)*

### Step 2: Access the Billing System (Admin Panel)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Acceptable usernames** | `SiyaB`, `Lucky`, `Oara` |
| **Password (all users)** | `sasingenje@25` |

> ⚠️ Only these three usernames work. No other credentials will grant access.

### Step 3: Understand Sentinel Grid Activation (Two Modes)

Sentinel Grid has **two distinct activation modes**:

| Mode | Trigger | What Happens |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Auto-Activation** | After 5 defense layers are exhausted | SG kicks in **automatically** — no manual action needed. Honeypots deploy, hackers see fake data, real billing system stays intact. |
| **Manual Full Protection** | Enter SG admin codes (see below) | Activates SG **immediately** without waiting for 5 layers to fail. 5 layers + SG = maximum protection. **No breach possible.** |

### Step 4: Manual Activation Codes (Full Protection — 5 Layers + SG)

Use these codes to activate Sentinel Grid **manually**:

| Code Type | Exact Code Value |
|-----------|------------------|
| **SG Code 1** | `SG-V2-ORION-7194!` |
| **SG Code 2** | `SG-V2-NOVA-4826!` |
| **SG Code 3** | `SG-V2-VAULT-9307!` |
| **DUO Code** | `482901` |

### Step 5: Key Test Case — Hacker Manipulates Client Bills

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **When SG is OFF** (after some or all layers are down) | Attack is a **SUCCESS**. Hacker can manipulate real billing data. |
| **When SG is ACTIVE** (auto OR manual mode) | Hacker gets an interface that looks **100% real**. Data and bills appear manipulatable — they can reduce, clear, and even erase bills. **BUT this is all fake data inside nested honeypots.** All municipality real data and bills stay **100% INTACT.** |

## 📚 Conclusions & Lessons Learned

**Security on the solution first, then the problem.**

The Ekurhuleni incident taught us that reactive security fails when attackers are already inside. Sentinel Grid flips the model:

- **Deception buys time** — Attackers waste minutes or hours inside honeypots
- **Everything is logged** — Every attacker move inside the honeypot is recorded
- **Data integrity is preserved** — Real billing data never gets touched
- **Attackers believe they won** — They don't try alternative attack paths

Our biggest lesson is that elegant security architecture must anticipate breach—and design for the moment after the perimeter falls, not before.

## ⚠️ Important Note

This prototype is for **educational, research, and defensive demonstration purposes only**. No real municipal data is used. All billing data, client records, and PII are simulated using JavaScript-generated fake data.
